# Disable Nuke Effects

Only put one script at a time otherwise they might override each other and cause undesired behavior.

## disable_nuke_effects_vision.gsc
Disables the brown-ish vision applied after a M.O.A.B detonates

## disable_nuke_effects_slowmo.gsc
Disables the slow motion effect happening while a M.O.A.B is detonating

## disable_nuke_effects_vision_and_slowmo.gsc
Disables both the vision and the slow motion effects

## disable_nuke_effects_all.gsc
Disables the vision and the slow motion and remove the fog/smoke appearing on the map for a few seconds after the M.O.A.B detonation. This removes all visual effects. The M.O.A.B will just kill every enemies without any added visual effect.
