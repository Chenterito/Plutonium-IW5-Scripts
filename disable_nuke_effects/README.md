# Disable Nuke Effects

Using several `disable_nuke_effects` scripts at the same time hasn't been tested but should work as long as they don't replace the same functions.

## disable_nuke_effects_vision.gsc
Disables the brown-ish vision applied after a M.O.A.B detonates

## disable_nuke_effects_slowmo.gsc
Disables the slow motion effect happening while a M.O.A.B is detonating

## disable_nuke_effects_emp.gsc
Disables the EMP effect applied to the losing team for 60 seconds after an enemy M.O.A.B has been detonated

## disable_nuke_effects_all_but_fog.gsc
Disables the 3 effects listed above while keeping the fog/smoke that appears in the map for a few second after a M.O.A.B detonates

## disable_nuke_effects_all.gsc
Disables all the effects listed above. When a M.O.A.B detonates it will only kill all the players on the other team without any added visual effect
