# Plutonium-IW5-Scripts

## What is this?

This is a collection of [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/docs/intro/) IW5/MW3 scripts I created, written in [GSC](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/gsc/).  
Some scripts (mostly older ones) have specific use cases and some others were made to be as generic as possible so you might find something useful.

I'm not the best at GSC and some scripts were made months ago when I wasn't as good as now so some scripts might not be perfectly optimized or done the proper way but they do their job and should at least give you an idea of how to do certain things or work well enough for you to use them.  

Huge thanks to everyone who helped me learn GSC: Birchy, DoktorSAS, FutureRave and other people on Discord.

## How do I download a script?

Click on a `.gsc` file and click on `Raw`.

Right click anywhere and click on `Save page as` (or an equivalent). 

Make sure to put `All` or `Any` for the file type and to add `.gsc` at the end of the file name.

## How do I use a script?

[Follow the instructions in the documentation](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/loading-mods/#iw5)

Simply drop a `.gsc` file inside `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5\scripts`.

Note that you can use `map_restart` in the [console](https://plutonium.pw/docs/opening-console/) to quickly restart your current game and reload scripts.
