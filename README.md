# Plutonium-IW5-Scripts

## What is this?

This is a collection of simple IW5 scripts I created, mostly for my servers.

I don't have any GSC knowledge so the scripts can probably be optimized but they do their job.

I was able to create these scripts with the awesome help of Birchy, DoktorSAS, FutureRave and other people on Discord (thanks!)

## How do I download a script?

Click on a `.gsc` file and click on `Raw`.

Right click anywhere and click on `Save page as` (or an equivalent). 

Make sure to put `All` or `Any` for the file type and to add `.gsc` at the end of the file name.

## How do I use a script?

[Follow the instructions in the documentation](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/loading-mods/#iw5)

Simply drop a `.gsc` file inside `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5\scripts`.

Note that you can use `map_restart` in the [console](https://plutonium.pw/docs/opening-console/) to quickly restart your current game and reload scripts.
