# Plutonium-IW5-Scripts

[![image](cover.jpg)](https://plutonium.pw/)

## What is this?

This is a collection of [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/docs/intro/) IW5/MW3 scripts I created, written in [GSC](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/gsc/).  
Some scripts (mostly older ones) have specific use cases and some others were made to be as generic as possible so you might find something useful.

Some scripts were made when I was still fairly new to GSC so some scripts might not be perfectly optimized or done the proper way but they do their job and should at least give you an idea of how to do certain things or work well enough for you to use them.  

Huge thanks to everyone who helped me learn GSC: Birchy, DoktorSAS, FutureRave and other people on Discord.

## How do I download a script?

- [Download this repository](https://github.com/Resxt/Plutonium-IW5-Scripts/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Open the downloaded ZIP file
- Drag and drop the script(s) you want in the folder they need to be placed in.  
If no instructions are provided for the script you want then simply follow the instructions given in [How do I use a script?](#how-do-i-use-a-script)

Just keep in mind that this downloads a copy of this repository at the moment you download it.  
If a script is updated after you downloaded this repository and you want the new version then you will need to download this repository again.

## How do I use a script?

[Follow the instructions in the documentation](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/loading-mods/#loading-existing-scripts-on-iw5)

Simply drop a `.gsc` file inside `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5\scripts`.

Note that you can use `map_restart` in the [console](https://plutonium.pw/docs/opening-console/) to quickly restart your current game and reload scripts.
