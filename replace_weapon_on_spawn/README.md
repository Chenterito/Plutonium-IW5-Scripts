# Replace Weapon On Spawn

A script to replace players weapon when they spawn.
This can easily be modified to always give a certain weapon or only give it when the player has a certain weapon etc.
This is useful to add ported weapons like the Intervention to your default classes until Plutonium adds the possibility to do it directly in dsr files.

## replace_rsass_with_intervention.gsc
Replace the RSASS with an Intervention (ACOG sight)
Replace the RSASS silencer with an Intervention (ACOG sight + silencer)
Gives a throwing knife and a tactical insertion in both cases
